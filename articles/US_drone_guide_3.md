# Request Authorization

**Requesting Authorization for Controlled Airspace** 

Controlled airspace is located in areas where there are generally more aircraft flying and are often found near airports, cities, and metropolitan areas. If you will be flying in controlled airspace, you must get an FAA airspace authorization.

Recreational flyers should not directly contact ATC facilities to request approvals.

You can request an airspace authorization by

1. Using an FAA approved LAANC UAS Service Supplier (USS). A listing of USSs are available on the FAA’s website: [UAS Data Exchange (LAANC) (faa.gov)](https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/data_exchange/)

2. The FAA’s DroneZone website: [https://faadronezone.faa.gov](https://faadronezone.faa.gov/)

The airspace authorization alerts FAA Air Traffic Control (ATC) that there are drones in the area

# 1. LAANC

**Using LAANC**

LAANC is an automated application and approval process for airspace authorizations in controlled airspace at or below 400ft.

You can access LAANC through an FAA-approved UAS Service Supplier (USS). The USSs make it easy to request an airspace authorization in near real-time using your computer or smart phone. Requests are checked against UAS Facility Maps, restricted airspace, airports and airspace classes, as well as TFRs.

The LAANC USSs display the maximum requested altitudes and show areas where no airspace authorizations will be given.

More information about LAANC, as well as a listing of current UAS Service Suppliers, can be found on the FAA website: [UAS Data Exchange (LAANC)](https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/data_exchange/)



**When to use LAANC?**

Drone pilots planning to fly under 400 feet in controlled airspace must receive an airspace authorization from the FAA before they fly. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is available to pilots operating under the [Small UAS Rule Part 107](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators) or under the exception for [Recreational Flyers](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_flyers).

To qualify under Part 107, you must register your drone and hold a [Remote Pilot Certificate](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/become_a_drone_pilot).

Recreational flyers must take The Recreational UAS Safety Test [(TRUST)](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_flyers/knowledge_test_updates) before they fly.



# 2. DroneZone

LAANC does not cover all controlled airspace. If you need to request an airspace authorization in an area not serviced by LAANC, you can use the [FAA’s DroneZone](https://faadronezone.faa.gov/).

To use DroneZone, create a recreational flyer account and follow the steps on screen to submit your airspace authorization request.

# UAS Facility Maps

**UAS Facility Maps (UASFMs)** 

[UAS Facility Maps](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/uas_facility_maps/) show the maximum altitudes in controlled airspace where the FAA may authorize drone flights. UASFMs do not “pre-authorize” drone flights in these areas, they are for informational or planning purposes only.

Recreational flyers who need to request an airspace authorization are encouraged to look at the UASFM prior to submitting their request to ensure their request will be below the UASFM maximum altitude limit.

You can see the grid map height limit on AirHub Portal app.



# Keep the Documents

If asked by law enforcement or FAA personnel, a recreational flyer must provide proof of drone registration and that they have completed this course. Both documents may be in paper or electronic format. Recreational flyers must also be able to explain which FAA-recognized CBO safety guidelines they are following
