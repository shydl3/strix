# 总结

所有空域限制都可以在[B4UFLY mobile app](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/b4ufly).实时查询。此处只是信息分类。

注意：2024年3月目前B4UFLY停止服务，需要FAA官网下载其他提供商的app，继续获得相关服务。例如AirHub，AutoPylot，Avision

## No Drone Zone

此区域一般**禁止起降**无人机，但是**可以飞越空域**。

注意 [No Drone Zone sign](https://www.faa.gov/uas/resources/community_engagement/no_drone_zone#entity) 区域标志。区域包括：

- FAA限制空域
- 当地限制空域
- 临时飞行限制（TFR）



## Airspace Restrictions

此区域一般包括：

- Stadiums and Sporting Events：棒球、足球等赛事活动**开始前一小时、结束后一小时**禁止飞行，区域为以场馆为中心的半径5.56Km圆形。
- 机场区域 (Near Airports)：此处为管控空域，飞行前需要获得空域批准，并带有网格高度限制。**Part 107和USC 44809监管的无人机可以通过 [LAANC](https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/data_exchange) 服务自动获得空域批准，但是遵循网格高度限制。**
- 未处于管控区域的机场：在400英尺 (121m)下飞行，避让其他飞行物。无需批准。



# Where Can I Fly?

Anyone flying a drone is responsible for flying within FAA guidelines and regulations.

## 1. [No Drone Zone](https://www.faa.gov/uas/resources/community_engagement/no_drone_zone)

The FAA uses the term "No Drone Zone" to help people identify areas where they cannot operate a drone or unmanned aircraft system (UAS). The operating restrictions for a No Drone Zone are specific to a particular location.

You can find out if there are airspace restrictions where you are planning to fly using the [B4UFLY mobile app](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/b4ufly).

### No Drone Zone Areas

- **Restricted Airspace:** The FAA prohibits drone flight over certain areas of airspace.
- **Local Restrictions:** In some locations, drone takeoffs and landings are restricted by state, local, territorial, or tribal government agencies. The FAA has provided [No Drone Zone sign](https://www.faa.gov/uas/resources/community_engagement/no_drone_zone#entity) that can be used by these governments to identify areas where there are local flight restrictions. **It is important to note, these No Drone Zones only restrict taking off or landing and do not restrict flight in the airspace above the identified area**.
- **Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs)** define a certain area of airspace where air travel is limited for a period and may be in place for different reasons. **The FAA may use the term "No Drone Zone" to identify an area where there is a TFR**. Examples include, major sporting events, space launch and reentry operations, presidential movements, or in security sensitive areas designated by federal agencies.



A No Drone Zone sign lets you know that taking off or landing your drone from the designated area is not allowed, per local restrictions. Be aware that even if you have an airspace authorization to fly in the airspace over this area, you **do not have authorization to take off or land from the property** designated as a local No Drone Zone. **In other words, airspace authorization does not mean land use approval**.



## 2. [Airspace Restrictions](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/airspace_restrictions)

There are many types of airspace restrictions in the United States. Below is a list of restrictions that commonly affect UAS flights

### 2.1 [Stadiums and Sporting Events](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/airspace_restrictions/sports_stadiums)

Flying drones in and around stadiums is prohibited starting one hour before and ending one hour after the scheduled time of any of the Stadiums Events. Such as Baseball, football, car events.

Specifically, UAS operations are **prohibited within a radius of three nautical miles (5.556 Km) of the stadium** or venue.

### 2.2 [Near Airports](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/airspace_restrictions/flying_near_airports)

For flight near airports in controlled airspace, drone operators **must receive an airspace authorization prior to operation.** Airspace authorizations come with altitude limitations and may include other operational provisions. Controlled airspace and other flying restrictions can be found on our [B4UFLY](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/b4ufly) app.

#### 2.2.1 Automated Authorizations Through LAANC

[Part 107](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators) remote pilots and [recreational flyers](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers) can get an airspace authorization for altitudes below the [posted UAS Facility Map grid altitudes](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/uas_facility_maps) automatically from a [LAANC](https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/data_exchange) service supplier.

#### 2.2.2 Authorizations Through FAADroneZone

You should use the [FAADroneZone](https://faadronezone.faa.gov/#/) to request an airspace authorization if any of the following apply:

- You want to fly in areas that are in controlled airspace and are not serviced by LAANC (the red [grids](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/uas_facility_maps) on the UAS Facility Maps)
- You are flying under Part 107 and want to fly in a "zero" grid area or above a [UAS Facility Map grid](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/uas_facility_maps) value
- You have a waiver under Part 107 and want to fly in controlled airspace using the waiver

#### 2.2.3 Airports in Uncontrolled Airspace

For flights near airports in uncontrolled airspace that remain under 400’ above the ground, prior authorization is not required. When flying in these areas, remote pilots and recreational flyers must be aware of and avoid traffic patterns and takeoff and landing areas. 

A drone must not interfere with operations at the airport must yield right-of-way to all other aircraft. Uncontrolled airspace and other flying restrictions can be found on our [B4UFLY](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/b4ufly) app.
