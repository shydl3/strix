# THE SPIRIT

"When we distill The Botanist, we are creating something more than a drink. The Botanist is a representation of the place we are from. It is a way of communicating our place in the world and our love for it.

"Distilling is a way of life, and for me it is a way of communicating to the world. We use the art of distillation and a connection to the land, our home, to create a wonderful gin that's the essence of Islay."

​																																																——**ADAM HANNETT, HEAD DISTILLER**

# TASTE NOTES

## BODY

Satin smooth; it glides across the palate. The viscosity of the liquid is exceptional.



## NOSE

Immediately a bouquet of herbal freshness, juniper and sweet citrus come to the fore. Allow a little time to open and the sweet, spicy and earthy notes of cassia and coriander set a base for the delicate complexity of the Islay 22. The scent of Islay botanicals gently rises, winding their wild aromas of mint, thyme, sweet gale, gorse, camomile – a green freshness – through the heart of The Botanist.



## TASTE

Rich and mellow, cool on entry then warming across the palate, stimulating the taste buds with a round mouthfeel and citrus freshness. The balance and complexity are distinctive. Sweet and earthy notes combine with the delicate floral and herbal notes of the Islay 22. Each sip reveals deeper layers and more complex combinations of delicate flavours. This complexity and versatility perfectly suit a creative serve of you own.



## FINISH

Relaxed and balanced. Water mint, hawthorn, wood sage, sweet cicely, cinnamon, citrus, soft juniper – a harmonious combination held together with a gentle, satin soft texture. The viscosity from an achingly slow distillation brings out the delicate essence of Islay, expressing a different balance of flavour, a different combination of botanicals, upon every taste.

# Biodiversity and The Botanist

Biodiversity provides the foundation for all human life. From the food we eat to the water we drink, it all relies on a healthy ecosystem, and loss of biodiversity can weaken this. Thus, The Botanist has committed to protecting plant biodiversity and conservation practices since its inception. In 2015, the distillery set up The Botanist Foundation to promote sustainability, biodiversity and conservation. The foundation has since funded local and international projects that do vital work in this field such as the Global Botanic Garden Fund, which boosts funding for smaller gardens in developing countries and biodiversity hot spots.

This holiday season marks the second year of a three-year partnership with the BGCI. With gardens in all corners of the earth, the money raised by these bottles will provide essential funding to a number of locations such as the San Francisco Botanical Garden in the United States, who are attempting to conserve rare magnolias through grafting, as well as working with extremely rare trees endemic to India and Canada. The unique label and capsule design of the bottle is inspired by the rare flora that the project is helping to save, including cloud forest orchids in Mexico and endangered cinnamon trees (Cinnamomum chemungianum) in India. The pack also includes a plant naming tag which encourages consumers to get to know their plants at home.
