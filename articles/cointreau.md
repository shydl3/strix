## Cointreau invented an entire category of liqueur.

Authenticity, avant-garde, elegance.

Since its creation in 1849, the Cointreau House expresses the same playfulness, driven by the creative impulse that gave it life. Balance, moments, pleasure, style… even in its creation.

Cointreau uses three types of orange in its liqueur: sweet, macerated, and bitter. Edouard Cointreau decided to call the concoction “[triple sec](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2015/06/cointreau-a-brand-history/),” a reference to the triple concentration of orange flavors in the liqueur, as well as the dryness of the spirit (“sec” means “dry” in French).

## Its oranges are well-traveled.

Cointreau is best known for one thing: orange liqueur. Though the spirit may sound simple, Cointreau’s triple sec is quite complex, made from three types of oranges sourced from across the globe. Its sweet orange peels are from Spain, Ghana, and Senegal, while its bitter oranges come from Brazil and Tunisia.

Cointreau hails proudly from the land of the baguette and croque monsieur, but you’ll often find it paired with carne asada and elotes. That’s because it’s a key ingredient in America’s favorite Mexican cocktail: the [Margarita](https://vinepair.com/articles/10-most-popular-margarita-recipes/). The origin of the Marg is unknown, but [legend](https://www.foodandwine.com/news/history-margarita-cointreau) has it that its original inventor was American Margaret Sames, who popularized the drink on a trip to Acapulco — famously saying, “A Margarita without Cointreau isn’t worth its salt.”

## Cosmopolitan

All traditional cosmos are made with roughly the same ingredients. Here's what you'll need for this cosmopolitan cocktail:

**Vodka**
Use high quality vodka for the most drinkable results.

**Lime Juice**
**Fresh lime juice is best. Don't throw that peel away! You can use it as a garnish.

**Cointreau Triple Sec**
**Triple sec adds sweet, citrusy flavor and tones down the taste of the vodka.

**Cranberry Juice**
You can use bottled or fresh cranberry juice. If the finished cocktail is too strong, you can add more juice to taste.
