# 总结

在美国，低于55 pounds (24.94 kg) 的无人机受到 [Part 107.](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators) (small UAS Rule) 通用监管 (Almost all non-recreational drone)。

纯粹个人娱乐目的 (purely for fun or personal enjoyment) 无人机可豁免Part 107，转而受[USC 44809](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title49-section44809&num=0&edition=prelim) 监管。

在USC 44809下飞行需满足：

1. 仅为个人娱乐目的
2. 遵守 [FAA-recognized Community Based Organization](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreationalfliers/faa-recognized-community-based-organizations) (CBO) 安全飞行指引
3. 保持视距飞行
4. 为其他飞行器让路
5. **在FAA管控区域 ([Class B, C, D, and surface Class E designated for an airport](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/airspace_101))飞行时，首先需要通过[LAANC ](https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/data_exchange)or [DroneZone](https://faadronezone.faa.gov/#/) 获得FAA批准；并且低于管控级别规定的高度。**
6. **在非管控空域飞行 (Class G) 低于 400 feet (121.92 m)**   Note: Anyone flying a drone in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) is responsible for flying within the FAA guidelines and regulations. That means it is up to you as a drone pilot to know the rules: [Where Can I Fly?](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/where_can_i_fly) 
7. 提前通过[ The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST)](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test_updates) 测试，飞行时携带测试通过证明。
8. 拥有FAA注册（https://faadronezone.faa.gov/#/），机身外部贴有注册号码 ((https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/uas/recreational_fliers/UAS_how_to_label_Infographic.pdf) ，飞行时携带注册证明文件。
9. 飞行时注意national airspace system安全。



# FAA原文

The rule for operating unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones under 55 pounds (24.94 kg) in the National Airspace System (NAS) is [14 CFR Part 107 (referred to as the Small UAS Rule)](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators). However, if you want to fly a drone for purely recreational purposes, there is a limited statutory exception ("carve out") that provides a basic set of requirements.



## What is a Recreational Flight?

Many people assume that a recreational flight simply means not flying for a business or being compensated. But, that's not always the case. Compensation, or the lack of it, is not what determines if a flight was recreational or not. Before you fly your drone, you need to know which regulations apply to your flight.

The default regulation for drones weighing under **55 pounds (24.94 Kg)** is Part 107. Almost all non-recreational drone flying is regulated by [Part 107.](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators)

Remember, if you’re not sure which rules apply to your flight, fly under Part 107.



## **Exception for Limited Recreational Operations** 

Congress created the **Exception for Limited Recreational Operations** of Unmanned Aircraft to allow those flying drones purely for fun or personal enjoyment to operate without complying with Part 107. People flying under this Exception are required to comply with all rules for recreational flyers.

The Exception for Limited Recreational Operations of Unmanned Aircraft ([USC 44809](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title49-section44809&num=0&edition=prelim)) is the law that describes how, when, and where you can fly drones for recreational purposes.

Following these rules helps keep people, your drone and our airspace safe:

1. Fly only for recreational purposes (personal enjoyment).
2. Follow the safety guidelines of an [FAA-recognized Community Based Organization](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreationalfliers/faa-recognized-community-based-organizations) (CBO).
3. Keep your drone within the visual line of sight or use a visual observer who is co-located (physically next to) and in direct communication with you.
4. Give way to and do not interfere with other aircraft.
5. Fly at or below FAA-authorized altitudes in controlled airspace ([Class B, C, D, and surface Class E designated for an airport](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/airspace_101)) only with prior FAA authorization by using [LAANC ](https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/data_exchange)or [DroneZone](https://faadronezone.faa.gov/#/).
6. Fly at or below 400 feet in Class G (uncontrolled) airspace.
   **Note:** Anyone flying a drone in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) is responsible for flying within the FAA guidelines and regulations. That means it is up to you as a drone pilot to know the rules: [Where Can I Fly?](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/where_can_i_fly) 
7. Take[ The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST)](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test_updates) and carry proof of test passage when flying.
8. Have a current FAA [registration](https://faadronezone.faa.gov/#/), [mark ](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/uas/recreational_fliers/UAS_how_to_label_Infographic.pdf)(PDF) your drones on the outside with the registration number, and carry proof of registration with you when flying.
   **Note**: Beginning September 16, 2023, if your drone requires an FAA registration number it will also be required to broadcast [Remote ID](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id) information (unless flown within a [FRIA](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id/fria)). For more information on drone registration, visit How to [Register Your Drone](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/register_drone).
9. Do not operate your drone in a manner that endangers the safety of the national airspace system.

**Individuals violating any of these rules, and/or operating in a dangerous manner, may be subject to FAA enforcement action.**
